Hi there
My name is Radek and I’m the author of this theme. I made it to help you present your ideas easier.

We all know how hard is to start something on the web, especially these days. You need to prepare a bunch of stuff, configure them and when that’s done — create the content.

This theme is pretty basic and covers all of the essentials. All you have to do is start typing!

The theme includes:

fully customizable color schemes generated by [terminal.css](https://panr.github.io/terminal-css/).
great reading experience thanks to [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode).
nice code highlighting thanks to [PrismJS](https://prismjs.com/) that matches the theme’s color scheme.
So, there you have it… enjoy!
